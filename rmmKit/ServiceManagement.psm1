    was supposed to be a module to manage custom executables with flags in the backround
    also need to manage services that need to be running
    if they are not, find out why automatically ( sort of | going to take a lot of effort on my part and a lot of customization depending on the service I think)
    manage auto restarts with logging when they fail
